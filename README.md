# Root-HTML
HTML page designed for the Introduction to Computer Graphics course, with elements in SVG.
The svg elements are encoded in the page "index.html", but are accessible separately under their respective names "baneary.html", "little elephant.html" and "flamingo.html", in addition to the file "flower.svg", available directly in svg to be used as the icon for the page and the "git.svg" file that contains the code for the GitHub logo.
The files "flamingo.cdr" and "little elephant.cdr" contain the sketch of the drawings made in corelDRAW.
